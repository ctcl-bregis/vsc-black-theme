# ctcl-black-theme for VSCode/VSCodium

After trying out Visual Studio Code, specifically the [VSCodium binaries](https://vscodium.com/), I decided to rewrite the theme I had for Geany under ["script-dump"](https://github.com/ctcl-bregis/script-dump/blob/main/themes/geany/black.conf) for Visual Studio Code.

So far, I have just tested the theme on VSCodium version 1.80.1 on Linux x86-64 platforms. 

I make improvements to the theme as I use it, so just a few languages and document formats are tested, which includes:

- CSS
- HTML
- Jinja2
- JSON
- Markdown
- Python
- Shell (BASH, sh, etc.)
- Rust
