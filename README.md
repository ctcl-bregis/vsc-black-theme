# ctcl-black-theme for VSCode/VSCodium

After trying out Visual Studio Code, specifically the [VSCodium binaries](https://vscodium.com/), I decided to rewrite the theme I had for Geany under ["script-dump"](https://github.com/ctcl-bregis/script-dump/blob/main/themes/geany/black.conf) for Visual Studio Code.

## Requirements

I have only tested/developed this theme on one system, with the following software versions:

- OS: Linux Mint 20.3 x86-64
- IDE version: VSCodium 1.80.1

Results with other environments may vary
